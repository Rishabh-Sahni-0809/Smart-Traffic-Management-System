## 📖 Overview  

The **Smart Traffic Management System** is an AI-driven solution designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections.  
It uses **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** for vehicle detection, **Reinforcement Learning + LSTM** for adaptive signal control, and traffic simulation to create an intelligent system that reduces congestion and improves mobility.  

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🚘 **Vehicle Detection** with real-time computer vision  
- 📊 **Traffic Counting & Analytics** for insights  
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Control** using RL & LSTM  
- 🔄 **Dynamic Signal Adjustment** based on live traffic data  
- 🛠️ **Modular & Scalable Architecture**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Technologies Used  

**Programming Languages & Frameworks**  
- Python 🐍  

**Libraries & Tools**  
- OpenCV – Vehicle detection & image processing  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch – Reinforcement learning & LSTM models  
- NumPy, Pandas – Data preprocessing & analytics  
- Matplotlib – Visualization & plotting  

**Algorithms**  
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for traffic prediction
