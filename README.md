ü§ñ About The Project
In this section, provide a more detailed overview of your project. You can discuss the problem your project solves, the motivation behind it, and what makes it unique.

For example:
"Traffic congestion is a major problem in urban areas, leading to increased travel times, fuel consumption, and pollution. This project aims to develop a smart traffic management system that can adapt to real-time traffic conditions. By using computer vision and machine learning, the system can analyze traffic flow and dynamically adjust traffic signal timings to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion."

‚ú® Key Features
List the main features of your project.

Real-time Traffic Analysis: Describe this feature. For instance, "Analyzes live video feeds from traffic cameras to detect vehicles and pedestrians."

Dynamic Signal Control: Explain this feature. For example, "Adjusts traffic signal timings based on traffic density and flow."

Web-based Dashboard: Detail this feature. For instance, "A user-friendly dashboard to monitor traffic and manually override signals if needed."
