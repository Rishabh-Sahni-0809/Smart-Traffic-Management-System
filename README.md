## Overview

Smart Traffic Management System is a Python-based solution that integrates **vehicle detection**, **traffic simulation**, and **reinforcement learning** to intelligently manage traffic signals in real time.  
By dynamically adjusting signal timings based on traffic flow, this system aims to reduce congestion, waiting time, and improve overall traffic throughput.

## Features

- ðŸš˜ **Vehicle Detection** using computer vision techniques  
- ðŸ“ˆ **Real-time traffic simulation & integration**  
- ðŸ¤– **Reinforcement Learning + LSTM** for adaptive signal control  
- ðŸ“Š **Traffic counting & analytics**  
- Modular architecture for easy extension or customization  

---

## Architecture & Workflow

1. **Input & Sensing**  
   - Live or pre-recorded video feeds  
   - Vehicle detection module extracts vehicle counts, positions  

2. **Traffic Modeling & Simulation**  
   - Integrated traffic simulation to model multiple lanes, intersections  
   - Predictive modeling using LSTM networks for short-term flow forecasting  

3. **Decision & Control**  
   - Reinforcement Learning agent takes simulation state, sensor data  
   - Adjusts signal timing (green/red cycles) to optimize metrics  

4. **Feedback Loop & Logging**  
   - System records performance data  
   - Agent learns from outcomes, adapts over time
